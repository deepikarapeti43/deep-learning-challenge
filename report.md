What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The target variable is y which is "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column

What variable(s) are the feature(s) for your model?
Feature variable is X which consists of all columns expect "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
"ENI" and "NAME" columns are removed
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Initially started off with 2 layers and with neuron count was 30 since accuracy score not reaching 75% increased the layers and neurons

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
My model reached accuracy score of 73% in 2nd and 3rd attempt if I increase layers and neurons accuracy score will improve

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
I have increased layers and neurons to increase model performance

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
Not major difference between the 2 models accuracy, can increase accuracy score by adding too many layers and neurons also might impact systemÂ performance
